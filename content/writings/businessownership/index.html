      <h2>Who Owns Your City?</h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>
        This research question was the subject of an investigation conducted
				between the dates of September 2018 to January 2019, to try to answer a
				simple question: <em>who really owns your city?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The key question was focused on trying to identify ultimate ownership of
				businesses that consumers frequent, and which of those businesses truly
				constituted the tag of being "locally owned". The research conducted
				focused on Pasadena, California as a case-study city, and consisted of
				trying to identify the source ownership of all 13,000+ Pasadena
				businesses.
      </p>

			<h3>Research Questions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Who owns the specific businesses I see in Pasadena? Including (per
					commercial property):</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Name and geographic region of owner or largest stakeholder</li>
					<li>Determination of business type: e.g. private, public, co-operative, etc.</li>
					<li>Number of locations (if chain)</li>
					<li>Gross revenue</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Aggregated statistics for the above criteria, in terms of total
					number of businesses in Pasadena</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Methods</h3>
			<p>For this investigation, research was conducted by taking the names
				of existing businesses in the Pasadena area, and following their
				ownership trail until the ultimate owner was identified. A variety of
				data sources were used to identify ownership (and other miscelleneous)
				information.
			</p>
			<p>The following data sources were used to compile final results:

				<ul>
					<li>Business information
						<ul>
							<li>Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)</li>
							<li>OpenCorporates (https://opencorporates.com/)</li>
							<li>Company / business websites</li>
							<li>Calling the business / company directly</li>
							<li>City records</li>
							<li>Reference USA</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Financial information
						<ul>
							<li>Reference USA</li>
							<li>Google Finance (https://www.google.com/finance)</li>
							<li>Company / business websites</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Location Information
						<ul>
							<li>Reference USA</li>
							<li>OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/)</li>
							<li>Google Maps (https://www.google.com/maps)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>General Background
						<ul>
							<li>(Film) The Corporation / Joel Bakan</li>
							<li>(Book) Colossus: how the corporation changed America / Jack Beatty</li>
							<li>(Book) Incorporate your business / Attorney Anthony Mancuso</li>
							<li>(Book) The corporation that changed the world : how the East India Company shaped the modern multinational / Nick Robins.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>The results of this research project consisted of a database storing key business information, including ownership. The database was derived primarily from data obtained from Reference USA – access which was provided from the Pasadena Public Library. This data was then supplemented with geographic information, like geo-location, from OpenStreetsMap’s Nomination Service.
Analytics from the resultant database were used to generate the below Infographic, with the help of the codebase below and visualization tools like Elastic Kibana.
			</p>

			<h4>Infographic</h4>
			<p>
				The below infographic represents a subset of aggregated results from this
				research exercise, specifically for Pasadena. Key findings highlighted
				below include:
				<ul>
					<li>A heat map of ownership of businesses in Pasadena, where
				ownership location is shown to be sourced from around the United States.</li>
					<li>Top corporate owners - by number of separate and individual
						properties owned in Pasadena</li>
					<li>Top corporate owners - by total revenue generated within Pasadena
					</li>
					<li>Top business earners - counting the total number of businesses
						categorized by the type of business operated</li>
					<li>Business location map - detailing the locations of select
						corporate owners and highlighting the numerous sub-businesses that
						are owned by them</li>
					<li>Top local food / drinks - a list of "locally owned" restuarants,
						cafes, bars, and light food joints that are owned by owners who's
						officies are located in Pasadena or nearby cities</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Code</h3>
			<p>One of the results of this project was to generate a codebase that
				could generate graphs, charts, and numerical data on the nature of
				business ownership for any city, including Pasadena, California.
			</p>
			<p>You may follow the below link and build / run the code below for any
				city in the United States or Canada, and generate similar charts as
				demonstrated in the infographic above</p>
