#         doesn't make sense for you to use the 
#         source as-is. Instead, feel free to take 
#         bits and peices if you find it useful. 
#         Note the GPL v2 license requires you to 
#         OPEN SOURCE your modified code. This makes 
#         sense typically all frontend website code 
#         is available publically anyway. :)
