#         doesn't make sense for you to use the
#         source as-is. Instead, feel free to take
#         bits and peices if you find it useful.
#         Note the GPL v2 license requires you to
#         OPEN SOURCE your modified code. This makes
#         sense typically all frontend website code
#         is available publically anyway. :)
